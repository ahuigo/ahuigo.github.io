参考李一的：如何理解各种从句逻辑：https://www.zhihu.com/question/31730389/answer/53104347?group_id=602183152467374080
英语中从句包两个概念:
1. 复合句(compound sentence,并列句)=简单句1+并列连词+简单句2
2. 复杂句(complex sentence)=简单句1+代词/副词/连词+简单句2

两者引导词区别是:
1. compound: 并列连词(but,and,for,...)
2. complex: 
    3. 代词+不完整句
    4. 副词、连词+完整句

根据引导词能连接句子的完整性:
1. 代词+不完整句(即SVtO缺少S或O)
2. 副词/连词+完整句子(即SVO俱全或者SVi不需要O)

# 复合句compound
并列连词即fanboys + and yet + and so，fanboys即下列连词的首字母缩写
1. for: I'd better take an umbrella, for it is going to rain.
2. and: His is so handsome and the princess is willing to marry him.
3. nor: The city is not beautiful, nor is it clean.即不漂亮，也不干净
4. but/while: I like action movies but/while she doesn't like them.
5. or: Take the chance, or you will regret.
6. yet: She walked slowly into the wall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, *yet* following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. 此句第一句S+V1+and+V2, 最后一句是是X,SV1结构
    1. and yet: 把上一句中的*yet*换成*and yet*
7. so: It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, *so* they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep and appointment.
    8. and so 与so 
9. Not..but: They are not the bones of animals, but (the bones) of human being.
9. Either: you must improve your work or I shall dismiss you. 要么你改进工作，要么我就辞退你。
10. Not only...but also: Not only does he like badminton, but also he can even write some. (也可不倒装)
11. Although...(yet): Although he was weak, (yet) he tried his best to work.

说明：
1. and therefore, and thus 不是连词合用，therefore/thus 是副词，做状语
2. Neither you nor I is to blame. 都不. 两主语合成一个
    3. Either you or I is to blame. 你或我会...
2. 常用伪连词(从句一部分):
    1. therefore, however,moreover/furthermore, nonetheless/nevertheless, 
    2. notwithstanding,
3. however用法：
    1. 句1. However, 句2 
    1. 句1; however,句2 
    1. 句1.句2第一部分, however,句2 剩余
    2. 句1. 句2, however.

# 复杂句complex 
分三类6种:
1. 名词性从句:
    1. 主语从句:
    1. 宾语:
    1. 表语: 从句做表语
    2. 同位语:跟在抽象名词后说明其具体内容
1. 形容词性从句
    2. 定语从句：
        3. 关系代词+不完整句
        4. 关系副词+完整句
1. 副词性从句
    2. 状语: 副词/连词+完整句

## 名词性从句
名从的结构如下:
1. that/whether/if + 完整句子
2. 特殊疑问词的陈述语序

### 主宾表从
that/whether/if+sentence:
1. That you are right is a lie.
2. I believe (that) you are right
3. I don't know whether/if he is trustworthy.

特殊疑问:
1. *What he wants to tell us* is not clear.

6. When: I hate it when they speak with their mouth full of food.(it是形式宾语)
7. whosever: Whosever umbrella this is is not my business.

### 同位语从句
同位语结构 : 抽象名词+主/宾/表从句 = 抽象名词+引导词+同位句
其中抽象名词起概括作用: fact, suggestion,....

that(注意这里that 是连词):
1. that: The girls were surprised at the *fact* *that* ocean ships can sail up the Great Lake.
2. that: There was a suggestion that Brown should be dropped from the team.

Whether:
1. The question whether we should call in specialist was answered by the family doctor.

特殊疑问词: what/who/whom/whose/when/...
1. I have no idea *what* size she wears.
2. We haven't yet settled the question where we are going to spend our summer vacation.

## 形容词定语从句
引导词在国内语法中常被称为关系词, 有两类

关系代词: that/which/who/whom/whose +不完整句子
0. Is he the man *who/that* wants to see you.
1. It's the only one *that* I've left. 
2. He is the man *whom/that* I saw yesterday.
3. They rushed over to help the man *whose* car had broken down.

关系副词when/where/why+完整句子
1. There are occasions *when*(on which) one must yield.
2. Beijing is the place where (in which) I was born.
3. Is this the reason why (for which) he refused our offer.

> 完整不完整不用纠结

## 副词状语从句
引导词只有副词和连词，所以只能引导完整句：
1. Time: *When* the dry desert ends, the green grass gross.
2. Address: *Where* there is a will, there is a way. 有志者
3. 原因: Collection provides relaxation for leisure hours, *as* just looking at one's treasures is always a joy. 收藏为闲暇时间提供了放松，因为欣赏自己的珍品总是一种乐趣。

5. 结果: Youth is *so* wonderful *that* it is a crime to waste.(that是连词)
6. 条件: If ..; 
7. Time: 一...就...: have no sooner...than../as soon as; 还没有...就: hardly...when
    1. I had no sooner got home than It began to rain.刚到家就下雨
    2. As soon as I got home, it began to rain.
    3. I had hardly/scarely got home when/before it began to rain. 还没到家就下雨
    4. // no sooner/hardly/scarely 可倒装于句首
