# cadence start
https://github.com/uber/cadence/blob/master/docker/README.md

## quick start
Exposes cadence frontend on ports 7933 (tchannel) / 7833 (grpc), web on port 8088, and grafana on port 3000

    git clone git@github.com:uber/cadence.git
    #cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/uber/cadence/docker
    cd cadence/docker
    docker-compose up


## production start
Using docker image for production

    docker run -e CASSANDRA_SEEDS=10.x.x.x                  -- csv of cassandra server ipaddrs
    -e CASSANDRA_USER=<username>                        -- Cassandra username
    -e CASSANDRA_PASSWORD=<password>                    -- Cassandra password
    -e KEYSPACE=<keyspace>                              -- Cassandra keyspace
    -e VISIBILITY_KEYSPACE=<visibility_keyspace>        -- Cassandra visibility keyspace, if using basic visibility 
    -e KAFKA_SEEDS=10.x.x.x                             -- Kafka broker seed, if using ElasticSearch + Kafka for advanced visibility feature
    -e CASSANDRA_PROTO_VERSION=<protocol_version>       -- Cassandra protocol version
    -e ES_SEEDS=10.x.x.x                                -- ElasticSearch seed , if using ElasticSearch + Kafka for advanced visibility feature
    -e RINGPOP_SEEDS=10.x.x.x,10.x.x.x                  -- csv of ipaddrs for gossip bootstrap
    -e STATSD_ENDPOINT=10.x.x.x:8125                    -- statsd server endpoint
    -e NUM_HISTORY_SHARDS=1024                          -- Number of history shards
    -e SERVICES=history,matching                        -- Spinup only the provided services, separated by commas, options are frontend,history,matching and workers
    -e LOG_LEVEL=debug,info                             -- Logging level
    -e DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH=<dynamic_config_file>   -- Dynamic config file to be watched, default to /etc/cadence/config/dynamicconfig/development.yaml, but you can choose /etc/cadence/config/dynamicconfig/development_es.yaml if using ElasticSearch
    ubercadence/server:<tag>

For more options to configure the docker, please refer to config_template.yaml.
For `<tag>`:
1. use `auto-setup` images only for first initial setup
2. and use `regular ` ones for production deployment. 

## build cadence image
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/uber/cadence
    git checkout YOUR_CHECKOUT_BRANCH_OR_TAG 
    docker build . -t ubercadence/<imageName>:YOUR_TAG

image target, There are three targets supported:

1. server. Default target if not specified. This will build a regular server binary.
2. auto-setup. The image will setup all the `DB/ElasticSearch` schema during startup.
3. cli. This image is for CLI.

# cadence service
https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/concepts/topology/#cadence-service

有4种：
1. Front End (FE): which is a stateless service used to handle incoming requests from Workers. It is expected that an external load balancing mechanism is used to distribute load between Front End instances.
1. History Service (HS): where the core logic of orchestrating workflow steps and activities is implemented
1. Matching Service (MS): matches workflow/activity tasks that need to be executed to workflow/activity workers that are able to execute them. Matching is assigned task for execution by the history service
1. Worker Service (WS - not shown on diagram): implements Cadence workflows and activities for internal requirements such as archiving



# cadence v23 vs v11
1. grpc supported. simple!
2. ttl and archive 可用
