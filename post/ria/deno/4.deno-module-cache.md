# deno cache
## lock.json
in case of the content in the remote url https://some.url/a.ts is changed, we should use lock.json to check subresource integrity for modules.


    // A lock.json might look like this 
    {
    "https://deno.land/std@0.147.0/textproto/mod.ts": "3118d7a42c03c242c5a49c2ad91c8396110e14acca1324e7aaefd31a999b71a4",
    "https://deno.land/std@0.147.0/io/util.ts": "ae133d310a0fdcf298cea7bc09a599c49acb616d34e148e263bcb02976f80dee",
    "https://deno.land/std@0.147.0/async/delay.ts": "35957d585a6e3dd87706858fb1d6b551cb278271b03f52c5a2cb70e65e00c26a",
    ...
    }

## where is cache dir
refer: deno-module.md

    $ deno info
    DENO_DIR location: ~/Library/Caches/deno
    Remote modules cache: ~/Library/Caches/deno/deps
    npm cache: ~/Library/Caches/deno/npm
    registries cache: ~/Library/Caches/deno/registries

## update/create lock.json
To update or create a lock.json

    //# Create/update the lock file "lock.json".
    $ deno cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write src/deps.ts
    $ deno cache --lock=lock.json --lock-write main.ts
    --lock=lock.json 
        tells Deno what the lock file to use is, 
    --lock-write
        is used to create/update dependency hashes to the lock file 

## download deps cache with verification
Collaborator on another machine -- in a freshly cloned project tree:

    # Download the project's dependencies into the machine's cache, integrity
    deno cache --reload --lock=lock.json src/deps.ts

## Runtime verification
Like caching above, you can also use the `--lock=lock.json` option during use of the deno run sub command, validating the integrity of any locked modules during the run. 

    // this only validates against dependencies previously added to the lock.json file. New dependencies will be cached but not validated.
    deno run --lock=lock.json mod.ts

using the `--cached-only` flag to require that remote dependencies are already cached.

    // This will fail if there are any dependencies in the dependency tree for mod.ts which are not yet cached.
    deno run --lock=lock.json --cached-only mod.ts
